<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-left:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;'>Like many companies, AULASNEO uses&nbsp;Cookies&nbsp;and other common&nbsp;Tracking Technologies&nbsp;on the&nbsp;AULASNEO Site&nbsp;and in email communications to help AULASNEO better understand your use and needs of the AULASNEO Site, current and future AULASNEO-related products and services, and how AULASNEO and Members can improve. For example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:0in;">
    <li>based on your cookie settings, AULASNEO tracks information indicating, among other things, which pages of the AULASNEO Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls were used;</li>
    <li>AULASNEO may log the IP address, operating system, and browser software (including mobile use and device type when you use AULASNEO native mobile apps) you used when accessing the AULASNEO Site, and AULASNEO may be able to determine from an IP address your Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of your point of connectivity; and</li>

</ul>
<p style='margin-right:0in;margin-left:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;'>You have some options for managing Cookies and other Tracking Technologies. These include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left:0in;">
    <li><u>Modifying your browser settings</u>: You should be able to control how and whether your web browser accepts Cookies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. The &ldquo;help&rdquo; feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new Cookies, how to receive notification of new Cookies, and how to disable existing Cookies. If you reject AULASNEO&rsquo;s Cookies, many functions and conveniences of the AULASNEO Site may not work properly.</li>
    <li><u>Opting-out of certain third-party tracking and advertising</u>: Some of the third parties used by AULASNEO or a Member for Cookies and Tracking Technologies offer the ability to opt-out from their tracking by following processes described on their websites.

In some cases, the AULASNEO Site and individual courses are integrated with third-party services or contain links to websites published by third parties, including other content providers as well as service providers.

This also includes providing opportunities for you to communicate with other users who may have similar interests or educational goals, for instance, recommending specific study partners or connecting potential student mentees and mentors. In such cases, AULASNEO and each Member that offers a course in which you enrolled may use all information collected about you to determine who might be interested in communicating with you, but will only provide others your username (for clarity, no disclosure of your real name or email address).</li>
    <li><strong>With employers, government programs, institutions, or other enterprises that sponsor your enrollment in a course for training or other educational purposes</strong> &ndash; If an entity pays for or otherwise sponsors your Verified Certificate or course participation, AULASNEO will share information with the entity as needed to confirm your enrollment, participation, progress, and completion status in that course.</li>
